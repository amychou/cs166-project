Your task is to implement the classes defined in these files:

   WeightBalancedTree.{h,cpp}
   SplayTree.{h,cpp}
   
To test your implementations manually, run the program ./explore and follow
the prompts.

To get some timing information and run our test harness, run ./run-tests.
Our test harness will do some basic correctness checks on your implementations.
These checks essentially only confirm that elements that should be present
indeed are marked as present and that elements that aren't present get marked
as absent. We do not, however, check that you're producing the right trees,
which is something you'll need to do through your own testing.

run-tests will then run a number of workflows on your implementation and
measure the runtime. You'll get much cleaner information if you crank the
optimization level up to the maximum by editing the Makefile to use -O3 and
disabling debugging.

Good luck, and have fun!
